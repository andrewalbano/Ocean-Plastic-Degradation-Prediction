# Ocean Plastic Degradation Rate Prediction Algorithms
 Optimistic promises of the benefits of plastics have largely come to fruition with their set of diverse properties and versatility, however, the challenge of waste management, particularly the accumulation of plastic in the ocean, has gained traction as a growing global challenge. Building on [previous research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14538-z), we seek to compare various machine learning algorithms for classifying the rate of degradation of plastic polymers in the ocean using only their physical properties. We narrowed down our features to a list of 6 candidates by considering correlation matrices, standard t-tests for significance, and considering the linear seperability of the features. We standardize the data and implement oversampling techniques to address bias in the dataset. We split the data into training, validation, and test sets. We attempted to optimize the hyperparameters using 3-fold cross validation. In feature pairs, we implemented linear svm models, svm models with an rbf kernel, svm models with a polynomial kernel, and neural networks. The decision boundary for each feature pair with optimized hyperparameters was compared to the ground truth and can be seen in the results folder. We are currently preparing additional results that track the accuracy of the test and validation sets while varying the hyperparameters. A paper on our findings is included in our repo.
